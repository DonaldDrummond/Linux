1. Process Management
    - ps
        - man ps
        - ps aux
        - ps wuaxf
        - ps wuaxf |grep sshd |grep -v grep |awk '{print $2}' |head -n 1
    - pgrep
        - pgrep sshd
        - pgrep -u root sshd
    - top
        - Ctrl + M
        - L
        - H
        - k
        - m
        - r
        - R
        - 1
        - h
    - kill
        - kill -l
        - kill -9 SIGKILL
        - kill -15 SIGTERM
        - kill -1 SIGHUP
        - kill [signal] %[job id]
    - pkill
        -[signal]
        --signal [value]
        -l
        -a
    - bg
        - % [job id]
    - fg
        - % [job id]
    - jobs

2. Loop Control Structures
    - for
     - for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do echo ${i}; done
     - for i in {1..5}; do echo ${i}; done
     - for i in $(seq 1 5); do echo ${i}; done
     - for line in `cat /etc/hosts`; do echo ${line}; done
     - for i in {1..10}; do echo touch file${i}.htm; done
     - for i in {1..10}; do touch file${i}.htm; done
     - for i in {1..10}; do mv file${i}.htm file${i}.html; done
     - for i in {1..10}; do cp file${i}.html file${i}.htm; done
     - for f in `ls *.htm`; do mv ${f} `echo ${f} | sed 's/htm/txt/'`; done
     - for file in /etc/*; do if [ "${file}" == "/etc/resolv.conf" ]; then countNameservers=$(grep -c nameserver /etc/resolv.conf); echo "Total ${countNameservers} nameservers defined"; break; fi; done
     
    - while
        - while [ 1 ]; do echo "Aaron Rogers is going to be mad as a result of the draft last night."; sleep 1; done

3. Socket and File Enumeration
    - ss
        -l
        -4
        -tcp
        -udp
        -n
        -nn
        
        0 - 1023 reserverd or privileged ports
        > 1023 fair game (could overlap with something else on your system)
    - lsof
     - -i
     - +M
     - -n
    - netstat
        -t
        -u
        -a
        -n
        -p
        - -plant

3. Practical Exercise
    1. List all processes by all users running on your system.
    2. Determine if the sshd process is running on your system and locate its pid.
    3. Start vi and move it to the background, confirm it is in the background with the jobs 
       command.
    4. Use the kill command to terminate the process associated with vi.
    5. Launch vi to edit a file called hello.txt and place it in the background.
    6. Use lsof to discover what files are open by the vi process.
    7. Use netstat to determine what services are bound to what ports
    8. Use ss to discover which services are bound to what ports on your system.
    9. Create a directory called qxopa
    10. Inside the directory qxopa create 10 files called file[1-10].htm
    11. Using a for loop move all the htm files to html
    12. Using a for loop move all the html files to htm
    13. Now create a duplicate copy of the files but their extension should be .htm
